# Harry-Potter-GSAP

## Overview
This JavaScript code is for a web-based application that sorts users into Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw) based on their name. The application uses the MD5 algorithm to generate a hash value from the name entered by the user. The hash value is then used to determine the user's house, and the result is displayed with an animation.

## Dependencies
This code uses the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) library to animate the application elements. It also requires the md5 package to be installed.

## Usage
To use this application, simply run the index.html file in a web browser. Enter your name in the text input field and click the "Sort Me!" button to see which Hogwarts house you belong to. The application will animate the sorting process and display the result with the corresponding house image.

## Code Structure
The code is divided into three main sections:

Declaration of variables and event listeners: This section declares all the necessary variables, such as the DOM elements and GSAP animations, and adds event listeners to trigger the sorting animation.
Sorting function: This function takes the user's name as input and generates a hash value to determine the user's Hogwarts house. It then displays the result with the corresponding house image.
Animation function: This function animates the result element and the sorting hat image to create a fun and engaging experience for the user.
